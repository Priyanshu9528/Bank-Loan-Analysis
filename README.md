## Project Overview

The **Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard** aims to help banks and financial institutions analyze the patterns behind loan approvals and rejections. This dashboard is built using Power BI to provide visual insights and trends, while SQL queries are used to clean and manipulate the raw data for meaningful analysis. 

### Features:
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the loan data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed using SQL to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Visualization**: An interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the trends in loan approvals, customer profiles, and loan statuses.
- **Key Metrics**: Loan approval rate, default rate, customer income distribution, and loan amounts.

## Live Project

## Data Sources
1. **Financial Loan Dataset** (`financial_loan.csv`): Contains customer demographics, loan information, and status.
2. **SQL Database** (`bank_loan.sql`): SQL queries for data manipulation and cleaning.
3. **Power BI Dashboard** (`Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard.pbix`): Visual representation of the data analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Used for creating the dashboard to visualize insights.
- **CSV/Excel**: Used as the source of raw data.

## Dashboard Insights
The Power BI dashboard includes the following key insights:
- **Loan Approval Distribution**: Shows the breakdown of approved vs. rejected loans.
- **Customer Profiles**: Analyzes customer age, income, and employment type.
- **Loan Amount Distribution**: Visualizes loan amounts based on customer demographics.
- **Default Rate**: Highlights trends in loan defaults by different customer segments.
- **Approval Prediction Factors**: Factors that are most influential in loan approval.

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Use the `bank_loan.sql` file to set up the database and load the data.
3. Import the `financial_loan.csv` file for further data manipulation and analysis.
4. Open the `Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard.pbix` file in Power BI to explore the interactive dashboard.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Filters**: Use filters in the Power BI dashboard to explore loan data based on various criteria (e.g., loan amount, customer demographics).
2. **Insights**: Visualizations provide insights into loan approval trends, customer behavior, and risk assessment.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate more advanced machine learning models to predict loan approvals based on customer profiles.
- Include more interactive features such as scenario analysis for different loan policies.
- Expand the dataset with additional financial metrics to deepen the analysis.

## Conclusion
The Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard provides a powerful tool for analyzing loan data, understanding customer behavior, and identifying factors influencing loan approvals. It offers a data-driven approach for improving loan approval processes and managing financial risks.
